BUMPER SHOT For 2 Players or Teams

Slide the pucks up in the alley... they hit off the cushions and zip back down and even knock your opponent's pucks into the pit area to stop them from scoring. Watch out, if you have too much zip... you might end up in the pit too! The first to reach 500 point is the winner.

1. Players take turns sliding one PUCK at a time.
2. Players slide their PUCKS up the right alley of the PLAYING FIELD toward the RUBBER CUSHIONS. The PUCK will hit the CUSHIONS and slide back down the left alley toward the score areas.

4. Player may not remove any PUCK from the PLAYING FIELD until the round is over.
5. Any PUCK that goes off the PLAYING FIELD is "out of play" until the end of the round.
6. After each player has used the supplied pucks, the round is over and scores are totaled.
7. Each puck in a score area, or on a line, has a score value. Whenever a PUCK is on a line, its score value is that of the line (see diagram).
8. The "PIT" area has no score value. Any PUCKS that land there must remain until the end of the round.
9. After the scores have been totaled, players remove their PUCKS and start the next round.
10. Players are allowed to knock and opponents PUCK in the "PIT" to keep it from having a score.
11. The player who reached "500" first is the winner.
